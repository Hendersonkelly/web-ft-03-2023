    <h2>Also known as "I swear guys I'm really not moving it"</h2>
    <p>Ouija Board</p>

    <p>One of the have-to activities at a sleepover. There was always a spirit nearby and willing to chat to little girls typically about murder and such freely. Oh and of course no one was ever moving it.  </p>

    <p>Trolls</p>

    <p>If the world of the spirits were too much for you that is ok. You can always rub the tummy of a creepy little wrinkly doll and make wishes. WIshed of course always came true if you believed with all your heart.</p>

    <p>Magic 8 ball</p>
    <img src="images/magic 8 ball.jpg" alt="" class=" img">
    <p>If waiting for wishes and for spirits to reach out was not quick enough for you, there was always the trsuty magic 8 ball. Quickly and easily get all you burning questions about the universe answered if they were in a yes/no format that is. Which really leaves no room for bias.</p>
