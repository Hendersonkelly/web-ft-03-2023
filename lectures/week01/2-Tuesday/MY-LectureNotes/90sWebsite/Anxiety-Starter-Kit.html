    <h1>Anxiety Starter Kit</h1>
    <h2>Also known as "It's just a game calm down."</h2>
  <p>Ring Water Game</p>

  <p>Who can forget the hours spent cursing and mashing the buttons of these toys as we mentally willed the ring to catch just one *bleepity bleep* time. Then there were the cheaters. You know who you are the swayers and turners claiming unfair vicotry. My thumbs still hurt.</p>

  <p>Tamagatchi</p>

  <p>Would you like to learn parenting and be distracted during school? Then the tamagatchi was for you. After success I feel like we should have gotten to upgrade to plant. Although if that were true so many more of us would have living plants after lockdown.</p>

  <p>Perfection</p>

  <p>So many can trace there panic about time pressure back to this game. Also why did it scare us everytime like it was brand new? I can still hear the clicking of the timer like Captain Hook and the crocodile. </p>
