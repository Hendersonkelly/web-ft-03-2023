    <p>The coveted electronic that would allow you to both listen to the radio and record to a tape at the same time. You dreamed that someday a John Cusak beauty would seranade you too to express his unending love in a seedy looking gray trench coat while your parents did not ask enough questions.</p>

    <p>The game that only recognized heteronormativity and would never let you have Dan. You would be disappointed one cryptic phrase at a time when the phone rang "He looks good in whatever he wears he is not wearing red."</p>

    <P>The way we started training children on screen time years ago. The food is taking too long, thats ok. Ben can whip out his gameboy and everyone at the table can be enriched with the noises of Tetris while mom orders another margarita. </P>
